# Home Assistant Ecosystem
The Home Assistant powered ecosystem I am building and maintaining for personal home use. The goal of this project is threefold: 

 1. cheap to build, maintain, and operate;  
 2. easy to use for non-technical people in the household.;  
 3. privacy focused, without impacting points 1 and 2.
